# Means, SDs, and sample sizes for GRIMMER-testing

A fictional dataset with means, standard deviations (SDs), and sample
sizes of flying pigs. It can be used to demonstrate the functionality of
[`grimmer_map()`](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/reference/grimmer_map.md)
and functions building up on it.

## Usage

``` r
pigs5
```

## Format

A tibble (data frame) with 12 rows and 3 columns. The columns are:

- x:

  String. Means.

- sd:

  String. Standard deviations.

- n:

  Numeric. Sample sizes.

## Value

A tibble (data frame).
