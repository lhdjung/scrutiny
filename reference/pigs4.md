# Data with duplications

A fictional dataset with observations of flying pigs. It contains
multiple duplicates. The dataset can be used to demonstrate the
functionality of `duplicate_*()` functions such as
[`duplicate_count()`](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/reference/duplicate_count.md).

## Usage

``` r

## Format

A tibble (data frame) with 5 rows and 3 columns, describing various body
measures of the fictional pigs. The columns are:

- snout:

  String. Snout width.

- tail:

  String. Tail length.

- wings:

  String. Wingspan.

## Value
