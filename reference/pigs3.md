# Binary means and standard deviations for using DEBIT

A fictional dataset with means and standard deviations from a binary
distribution related to flying pigs. It can be used to demonstrate the
functionality of
[`debit_map()`](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/reference/debit_map.md)
and functions building up on it.

## Usage

``` r
pigs3
```

## Format

A tibble (data frame) with 7 rows and 3 columns. The columns are:

- x:

  String. Means.

- sd:

  String. Standard deviations.

- n:

  Numeric. Sample sizes.

## Value

A tibble (data frame).
