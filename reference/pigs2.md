# Percentages and sample sizes for GRIM-testing

A fictional dataset with percentages and sample sizes of flying pigs. It
can be used to demonstrate the functionality of
[`grim_map()`](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/reference/grim_map.md),
particularly its `percent` argument, and functions building up on it.

## Usage

``` r
pigs2
```

## Format

A tibble (data frame) with 6 rows and 2 columns. The columns are:

- x:

  String. Percentages.

- n:

  Numeric. Sample sizes.

## Value

A tibble (data frame).
