# Introductory notes ------------------------------------------------------

# Analytic-GRIMMER (A-GRIMMER) was developed by AurÃ©lien Allard
# (https://aurelienallard.netlify.app/post/anaytic-grimmer-possibility-standard-deviations/).
# His original algorithm received some modifications here, for these reasons:
# -- Tapping scrutiny's infrastructure for implementing error detection
# techniques; for example, functions like `reround()` and
# `decimal_places_scalar()`.
# -- Changing the return value to logical, which is the expected output from the
# basic implementation of any consistency test within scrutiny.
# -- Adjusting variable names to the tidyverse style guide and scrutiny's
# domain-specific conventions.
# -- Adding support for multi-item scales (see `items` argument) via
# `rsprite2::GRIMMER_test()`.

#' The GRIMMER test (granularity-related inconsistency of means mapped to error
#' repeats)
#'
#' @description `grimmer()` checks if reported mean and SD values of integer
#'   data are mathematically consistent with the reported sample size and the
#'   number of items that compose the mean value. It works much like [`grim()`].
#'
#'   The function is vectorized, but it is recommended to use [`grimmer_map()`]
#'   for testing multiple cases.
#'
#' @param x String. The reported mean value.
#' @param sd String. The reported standard deviation.
#' @param n Integer. The reported sample size.
#' @param items Integer. The number of items composing the `x` and `sd` values.
#'   Default is `1`, the most common case.
#' @param show_reason Logical. For internal use only. If set to `TRUE`, the
#'   output is a list of length-2 lists which also contain the reasons for
#'   inconsistencies. Don't specify this manually; instead, use `show_reason` in
#'   [`grimmer_map()`]. See there for explanation. Default is `FALSE`.
#'
#' @inheritParams grim
#'
#' @return Logical. `TRUE` if `x`, `sd`, `n`, and `items` are mutually
#'   consistent, `FALSE` if not.

#' @details GRIMMER was originally devised by Anaya (2016). The present
#'   implementation follows Allard's (2018) refined Analytic-GRIMMER algorithm.
#'   It uses a variant of Analytic-GRIMMER first implemented in
#'   \href{https://lukaswallrich.github.io/rsprite2/reference/GRIMMER_test.html}{`rsprite2::GRIMMER_test()`}
#'   that can be applied to multi-item scales.
#'
#'   The scrutiny version embeds GRIMMER in the broader system of consistency
#'   testing, as laid out in
#'   \href{https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/articles/consistency-tests-in-depth.html}{*Consistency
#'   tests in depth*}. The `grimmer()` function
#'   is a vectorized (multiple-case) version of this basic implementation. For
#'   more context and variable name translations, see the top of the R/grimmer.R
#'   source file.
