#' The GRIM test (granularity-related inconsistency of means)
#'
#' @description `grim()` checks if a reported mean value of integer data is
#'   mathematically consistent with the reported sample size and the number of
#'   items that compose the mean value.
#'
#'   Set `percent` to `TRUE` if `x` is a percentage. This will convert `x` to a
#'   decimal number and adjust the decimal count accordingly.
#'
#'   The function is vectorized, but it is recommended to use [`grim_map()`] for
#'   testing multiple cases.
#'
#' @details The `x` values need to be strings because only strings retain
#'   trailing zeros, which are as important for the GRIM test as any other
#'   decimal digits.
#'
#'   Use [`restore_zeros()`] on numeric values (or values that were numeric
#'   values at some point) to easily supply the trailing zeros they might once
#'   have had. See documentation there.
#'
#'   Browse the source code in the grim.R file. `grim()` is a vectorized version
#'   of the internal `grim_scalar()` function found there.
#'
#' @param x String. The reported mean or percentage value.
#' @param n Integer. The reported sample size.
#' @param items Numeric. The number of items composing `x`. Default is 1, the
#'   most common case.
#' @param percent Logical. Set `percent` to `TRUE` if `x` is a percentage. This
#'   will convert it to a decimal number and adjust the decimal count (i.e.,
#'   increase it by 2). Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param show_rec Logical. For internal use only. If set to `TRUE`, the output
#'   is a matrix that also contains intermediary values from GRIM-testing. Don't
#'   specify this manually; instead, use `show_rec` in [`grim_map()`]. Default
#'   is `FALSE`.
#' @param rounding String. Rounding method or methods to be used for
#'   reconstructing the values to which `x` will be compared. Default is
#'   `"up_or_down"` (from 5).
#' @param threshold Numeric. If `rounding` is set to `"up_from"`, `"down_from"`,
#'   or `"up_from_or_down_from"`, set `threshold` to the number from which the
#'   reconstructed values should then be rounded up or down. Otherwise, this
#'   argument plays no role. Default is `5`.
#' @param symmetric Logical. Set `symmetric` to `TRUE` if the rounding of
#'   negative numbers with `"up"`, `"down"`, `"up_from"`, or `"down_from"`
#'   should mirror that of positive numbers so that their absolute values are
#'   always equal. Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param tolerance Numeric. Tolerance of comparison between `x` and the
#'   possible mean or percentage values. Default is circa 0.000000015
#'   (1.490116e-08), as in [`dplyr::near()`].
#'
#' @return Logical. `TRUE` if `x`, `n`, and `items` are mutually consistent,
#'   `FALSE` if not.
#'
#' @seealso [`grim_map()`] applies `grim()` to any number of cases at once.

#' # A mean of 5.19 is not consistent with a sample size of 28:
#' grim(x = "5.19", n = 28)    # `x` in quotes!
#'
#' # However, it is consistent with a sample size of 32:
#' grim(x = "5.19", n = 32)
#'
#' # For a scale composed of two items:
#' grim(x = "2.84", n = 16, items = 2)

#' # With percentages instead of means -- here, 71%:
