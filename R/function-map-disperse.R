#' Create new `*_map_disperse()` functions
#'
#' @description `function_map_disperse()` is the engine that powers
#'   `grim_map_disperse()`. It creates new, "manufactured" functions for
#'   consistency tests which take reported summary statistics such as means, to
#'   apply those tests in cases where only a total sample size is known, not
#'   group sizes.
#'
#'   If functions created this way are exported from other packages, they should
#'   be written as if they were created with
#'   \href{https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/faq-adverbs-export.html}{purrr
#'   adverbs}; see explanations there and examples below.
#'
#' @param .fun Function (length 1) such as `grim_map`: It will be used to test
#'   rows in a data frame for consistency.
#' @param .name_test String (length 1). The name of the consistency test, such
#'   as `"GRIM"`, to be optionally shown in a message when using the
#'   manufactured function.
#' @param .dispersion,.n_min,.n_max,.show_all Arguments passed down to
#'   `disperse_total()`, using defaults from there.
#' @param ... Arguments passed down to `.fun`.
#'
#' @details This function is a so-called function factory: It produces other
#'   functions, such as `grim_map_disperse()`. More specifically, it is a
#'   function operator (a.k.a. decorator) because it also takes functions as
#'   inputs, such as `grim_map()`. See Wickham (2019, ch. 10-11).
