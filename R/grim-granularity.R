#' Granularity of non-continuous scales
#'
#' @description `grim_granularity()` computes the minimal difference between two
#'   means or proportions of ordinal or interval data.
#'
#'   `grim_items()` is the reverse: It converts granularity values to the number
#'   of scale items, which might then be used for consistency testing functions
#'   such as `grim()`.
#'
#' @details These two functions differ only in the names of their arguments ---
#'   the underlying formula is the same (and it's very simple). However, for
#'   clarity, they are presented as distinct.
#'
#'   The output of `grim_items()` should be whole numbers, because scale items
#'   have a granularity of 1.
#'
#'   It would be wrong to determine a scale's granularity from the minimal
#'   distance between two values in a given distribution. This would only
#'   signify how those values actually do differ, not how they *can* differ *a
#'   priori* based on scale design. Also, keep in mind that continuous scales
#'   have no granularity at all.
#'
#' @param n Numeric. Sample size.
#' @param items Numeric. Number of items composing the scale. Default is 1,
#'   which will hold for most non-Likert scales.
#' @param gran Numeric. Granularity.
#' @param tolerance Numeric. Any difference between `x` and a truncated version
#'   of `x` less than `tolerance` (in the absolute value) will be ignored. The
#'   default is close to `1 / (10 ^ 8)`. This avoids errors due to spurious
#'   precision in floating-point arithmetic.

#' # If a non-Likert scale ranges from 0 to 3
#' # and measures 16 cases:
#' grim_granularity(n = 16)   # `items = 1` by default
#'
#' # Same but Likert scale with 2 items:
#' grim_granularity(n = 16, items = 2)
#'
#' # If a scale is applied to a single case
#' # and has a granularity of 0.5:
#' grim_items(n = 1, gran = 0.5)
#'
#' # With more cases, a warning appears
#' # because items can only be whole numbers:
#' grim_items(n = c(10, 15, 20), gran = 0.5)
