For this version, I have removed numeric inputs to packageVersion(), as requested by CRAN.

A NOTE on the description field of the DESCRIPTION file might refer to:
- The DOI <doi:10.1177/1948550616673876>, which is valid (but might be flagged).
- The names of two authors of the references ('Allard' and 'Heathers').
