## New version 0.2.3

The CRAN check's NOTE on the description field of the DESCRIPTION file might refer to:

-   The names of two authors of the references ('Allard' and 'Heathers').

-   The URL <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550616673876/>, which is only invalid because of the trailing slash. The corresponding DOI is also flagged by CRAN.
