## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I now have:

* Added references to the description field of the DESCRIPTION file.

* Added \value sections to all .Rd files in which they had been missing.

* Removed problematic examples.

* Increased required version of R to >= 3.4.0, and of the 'rlang' package to >= 1.0.2.
