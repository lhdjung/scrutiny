## Resubmission
For this version, I have replaced the URL <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550616673876/> by the DOI <doi:10.1177/1948550616673876> in the description field.

A NOTE on the description field of the DESCRIPTION file might refer to:
- The DOI mentioned above, which is valid (but might be flagged).
- The names of two authors of the references ('Allard' and 'Heathers').

I'm submitting this new version somewhat early for compatibility with the upcoming dplyr 1.1.0.
