Software for error detection goes well beyond scrutiny. This vignette presents broadly similar packages and apps, with no claim to completeness.

Please contact me if you know about relevant software that isn't listed here (email: jung-lukas\@gmx.net).

-   For good reason, [statcheck](http://statcheck.io/index.php) by Sacha Epskamp and Mich√®le Nuijten is the best-known error detection software. It reconstructs *p*-values and tests them for consistency with their respective statistic, such as *t* or *F*. Even better, it scans PDF files automatically, enabling users to scan [massive amounts](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) of published articles.
-   James Heathers' [SPRITE](https://peerj.com/preprints/26968v1/) algorithm reconstructs possible distributions of raw data from summary statistics. James also wrote a [light introduction](https://medium.com/hackernoon/introducing-sprite-and-the-case-of-the-carthorse-child-58683c2bfeb) to SPRITE. For R users, it was implemented in [rsprite2](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/rsprite2/) by Lukas Wallrich, building up on code by Nick Brown. Nick also developed an interactive [Shiny app](https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/sprite/) for SPRITE based on R. Jordan Anaya developed a [Python-based app](http://www.prepubmed.org/sprite/).
