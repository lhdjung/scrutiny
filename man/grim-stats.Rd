\usage{
grim_total(x, n, items = 1, percent = FALSE)

grim_ratio(x, n, items = 1, percent = FALSE)

grim_ratio_upper(x, percent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{String or numeric. Mean or percentage value computed from data with
integer units (e.g., mean scores on a Likert scale or percentage of study
participants in some condition). \emph{Note}: Numeric inputs don't include
trailing zeros, although these are important for both functions. See
documentation for \code{grim()}.}

\item{n}{Integer. Sample size corresponding to \code{x}.}

\item{items}{Integer. Number of items composing the mean or percentage value
in question. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{percent}{Boolean. Set \code{percent} to \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is expressed as a
proportion of 100 rather than 1. The functions will then account for this
fact through increasing the decimal count by 2. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Integer or double. The number or proportion of possible GRIM
inconsistencies.
}
\description{
Even without GRIM-testing, means / proportions and sample sizes
of granular distributions entail some key data:
\itemize{
\item \code{grim_total()} returns the absolute number of GRIM-inconsistencies that
are possible given the mean or percentage's number of decimal places (\code{D})
and the corresponding sample size.
\item \code{grim_ratio()} returns a proportion that is normalized by \code{10^D}, and
therefore comparable across mean or percentage values reported to varying
\code{D}.
\item \code{grim_ratio_upper()} returns the upper bound of \code{grim_ratio()} for a
given \code{D}.

\examples{
# Many value sets are inconsistent here:
grim_total(x = "83.29", n = 21)
grim_ratio(x = "83.29", n = 21)

# No sets are inconsistent in this case...
grim_total(x = "5.14", n = 83)
grim_ratio(x = "5.14", n = 83)

# ... but most would be if `x` was a percentage:
grim_total(x = "5.14", n = 83, percent = TRUE)
grim_ratio(x = "5.14", n = 83, percent = TRUE)
