\title{Possible GRIM inconsistencies}
\usage{
grim_probability(x, n, items = 1, percent = FALSE)

grim_ratio(x, n, items = 1, percent = FALSE)

grim_total(x, n, items = 1, percent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{String (length 1). Mean or percentage value computed from data with
integer units, e.g., mean scores on a Likert scale or percentage of study
participants in some condition. It has to be string to capture any trailing
zeros.}

\item{n}{Integer. Sample size corresponding to \code{x}.}

\item{items}{Integer. Number of items composing the mean or percentage value
in question. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{percent}{Logical. Set \code{percent} to \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is expressed as a
proportion of 100 rather than 1. The functions will then account for this
fact through increasing the decimal count by 2. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Integer or double. The number of possible GRIM inconsistencies, or
their probability for a random mean or percentage with a given number of
decimal places.
}
\description{
These functions compute statistics related to GRIM-testing. In
general, \code{grim_probability()} is the most useful of them, and it is
responsible for the \code{probability} column in a data frame returned by
\code{\link[=grim_map]{grim_map()}}.
\itemize{
\item \code{grim_probability()} returns the probability that a reported mean or
percentage of integer data that is random except for the number of its
decimal places is inconsistent with the reported sample size. For example,
the mean 1.23 is treated like any other mean with two decimal places.
\item \code{grim_ratio()} is equal to \code{grim_probability()} unless \code{grim_ratio()} is
negative, which can occur if the sample size is very large. Strictly
speaking, this is more informative than \code{grim_probability()}, but it is
harder to interpret.
\item \code{grim_total()} returns the absolute number of GRIM-inconsistencies that
are possible given the mean or percentage's number of decimal places and
the corresponding sample size.

\examples{
# Many value sets are inconsistent here:
grim_probability(x = "83.29", n = 21)
grim_total(x = "83.29", n = 21)

# No sets are inconsistent in this case...
grim_probability(x = "5.14", n = 83)
grim_total(x = "5.14", n = 83)

# ... but most would be if `x` was a percentage:
grim_probability(x = "5.14", n = 83, percent = TRUE)
grim_total(x = "5.14", n = 83, percent = TRUE)
