\title{Lay out hypothetical group sizes}
\usage{
disperse(n, dispersion = 0:5, x_low = NA, x_high = NA, zero = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Numeric. Number from which to go up and down. This might be half the
total sample size if that number is even. You may want to choose a number
around half if it is odd.}

\item{dispersion}{Numeric. Vector that determines the steps up and down from
\code{n}. Default is \code{0:5}.}

\item{x_low, x_high}{Optionally, combine the low and high hypothetical group
sizes with other values, such as means. Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{zero}{Boolean. If set to \code{TRUE}, allows empty groups. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame).
}
\description{
Some published studies only report a total sample size but no
group sizes. However, group sizes are crucial for procedures such as GRIM.
Call \code{disperse()} to get a bird's-eye view of possible group sizes that all
add up to the total sample size.

For convenience, mean (or other) values corresponding to the hypothetical
sample sizes can be added.
}
\details{
All negative group sizes and their complements are internally
removed. By default (\code{zero = FALSE}), group sizes of 0 and their
complements are also removed.
}
\examples{
# For a total sample size of 40,
# you may set `n` to `20`:
disperse(n = 20)

# Specify `dispersion` to control
# the steps up and down from `n`:
disperse(n = 20, dispersion = c(3, 6, 10))

# Specify `x_low` and `x_high` to add
# corresponding values, such as means:
disperse(n = 20, x_low = "4.71", x_high = "5.3")
}
