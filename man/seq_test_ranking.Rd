Run this function after generating a sequence with
\code{seq_endpoint_df()} or \code{seq_distance_df()} and testing it with one of
scrutiny's mapping functions, such as \code{grim_map()}. It will rank the test's
consistent and inconsistent results by their positions in the sequence.
}

The function checks the provenance of the test results and throws a
warning if it's not correct.
