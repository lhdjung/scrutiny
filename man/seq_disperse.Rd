\title{Sequence generation with dispersion at decimal level}
\usage{
seq_disperse(
  from,
  dispersion = 1:5,
  string_output = "auto",
  include_reported = TRUE
)

seq_disperse_df(
  .from,
  ...,
  .dispersion = 1:5,
  .string_output = "auto",
  .include_reported = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from, .from}{Numeric (or string coercible to numeric). Starting point of
the sequence.}

\item{dispersion, .dispersion}{Numeric. Vector that determines the steps up
and down, starting at \code{from} (or \code{.from}, respectively) and proceeding on
the level of its last decimal place. Default is \code{1:5}, i.e., five steps up
and down.}

\item{string_output, .string_output}{Boolean or string. If \code{TRUE}, the output
is a string vector. Decimal places are then padded with zeros to match
\code{from}'s number of decimal places. Default is \code{"auto"}, which works like
\code{TRUE} if and only if \code{from} (\code{.from}) is a string.}

\item{include_reported, .include_reported}{Boolean. Should \code{from} (\code{.from})
itself be part of the sequence built around it? Default is \code{TRUE} for the
sake of continuity, but this can be misleading if the focus is on the
dispersed values, as opposed to the input.}

\description{
\code{seq_disperse()} creates a sequence around a given number. It
goes a specified number of steps up and down from it. Step size depends on
the number's decimal places. For example, \code{7.93} will be surrounded by
values like \code{7.91}, \code{7.92}, and \code{7.94}, \code{7.95}, etc.

\code{seq_disperse_df()} is a variant that creates a data frame. Further columns
can be added as in \code{tibble::tibble()}. Regular arguments are the same as in
\code{seq_disperse()}, but with a dot before each.
}
\examples{
# Basic usage:
seq_disperse(from = 4.02)

# If trailing zeros matter,
# set `string_output` to `TRUE`:
seq_disperse(from = 4.02, string_output = TRUE)

# Data fame variant:
seq_disperse_df(.from = 4.02)

# Control steps up and down with
# `dispersion` (default is `1:5`):
seq_disperse(from = 4.02, dispersion = 1:10)
seq_disperse(from = 4.02, dispersion = seq(2, 10, 2))
}
\seealso{
Conceptually, \code{seq_disperse()} is a blend of two function families:
\code{seq_endpoint()} and \code{disperse()}.
