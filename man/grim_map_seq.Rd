\usage{
grim_map_seq(
  data,
  x = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  var = Inf,
  dispersion = 1:5,
  out_min = "auto",
  out_max = NULL,
  include_reported = FALSE,
  include_consistent = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that \code{grim_map()} could take.}

\item{x, n}{Optionally, specify these arguments as column names in \code{data}.}

\item{var}{String. Names of the columns that will be dispersed. Default is
\code{c("x", "n")}.}

\item{dispersion}{Numeric. Sequence with steps up and down from the \code{var}
inputs. It will be adjusted to these values' decimal levels. For example,
with a reported \code{8.34}, the step size is \code{0.01}. Default is \code{1:5}, for five
steps up and down.}

\item{out_min, out_max}{If specified, output will be restricted so that it's
not below \code{out_min} or above \code{out_max}. Defaults are \code{"auto"} for
\code{out_min}, i.e., a minimum of one decimal unit above zero; and \code{NULL} for
\code{out_max}, i.e., no maximum.}

\item{include_reported}{Logical. Should the reported values themselves be
included in the sequences originating from them? Default is \code{FALSE} because
this might be redundant and bias the results.}

\item{include_consistent}{Logical. Should the function also process
consistent cases (from among those reported), not just inconsistent ones?
Default is \code{FALSE} because the focus should be on clarifying
inconsistencies.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed down to \code{grim_map()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame) with detailed test results.
}
\description{
\code{grim_map_seq()} performs GRIM-testing with values surrounding
the input values. This provides an easy and powerful way to assess whether
small errors in computing or reporting may be responsible for GRIM
inconsistencies in published statistics.

Call \code{\link[=audit_seq]{audit_seq()}} on the results for summary statistics.
}
\section{Summaries with \code{audit_seq()}}{
 You can call \code{audit_seq()} following
\code{grim_map_seq()}. It will return a data frame with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{x} and \code{n} are the original inputs,
tested for \code{consistency} here.
\item \code{hits_total} is the total number of GRIM-consistent value sets
found within the specified \code{dispersion} range.
\item \code{hits_x} is the number of GRIM-consistent value sets
found by varying \code{x}.
\item Accordingly with \code{n} and \code{hits_n}.
\item (Note that any consistent reported cases will be counted by the
\verb{hits_*} columns if both \code{include_reported} and \code{include_consistent}
are set to \code{TRUE}.)
\item \code{diff_x} reports the absolute difference between \code{x} and the next
consistent dispersed value (in dispersion steps, not the actual numeric
difference). \code{diff_x_up} and \code{diff_x_down} report the difference to the
next higher or lower consistent value, respectively.
\item \code{diff_n}, \code{diff_n_up}, and \code{diff_n_down} do the same for \code{n}.
}

Call \code{audit()} following \code{audit_seq()} to summarize results even further.
It's mostly self-explaining, but \code{na_count} and \code{na_rate} are the number
and rate of times that a difference could not be computed because of a lack
of corresponding hits within the \code{dispersion} range.

\examples{
# `grim_map_seq()` can take any input
# that `grim_map()` can take:
pigs1

# All the results:
out <- grim_map_seq(pigs1, include_consistent = TRUE)
out

# Case-wise summaries with `audit_seq()`
# can be more important than the raw results:
out \%>\%
  audit_seq()
