\title{Reverse and summarize the \verb{*_map_disperse()} process}
\usage{
reverse_map_disperse(data)

summarize_map_disperse(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame). For an explanation of
\code{summarize_map_disperse()}'s output using the example of GRIM, see
\code{grim_map_disperse()}, section \emph{Summaries with \code{audit()}}.
}
\description{
Two functions that deal with the output of a function created by
\code{function_map_disperse()}:
\itemize{
\item \code{reverse_map_disperse()} reconstructs the data frame of reported
statistics which the manufactured function took as an input.
\item \code{summarize_map_disperse()} computes summaries of the output of the
manufactured function and attaches them to the reconstructed input. This
can be useful as a helper within \code{audit()} methods for classes created by
\code{function_map_disperse()}.
}
}
\examples{
# Original data frame:
df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~x1,    ~x2,   ~n,
  "3.43", "5.28", 90,
  "2.97", "4.42", 103
)

# Test it using a product of the
# `function_map_disperse()` factory:
df_tested <- grim_map_disperse(df)
df_tested

# Reconstruct the original data frame:
reverse_map_disperse(df_tested)

# Compute summary statistics:
summarize_map_disperse(df_tested)
}
