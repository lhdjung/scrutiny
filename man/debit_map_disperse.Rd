\usage{
debit_map_disperse(
  data,
  fun = .fun,
  reported = .reported,
  name_test = .name_test,
  name_class = .name_class,
  dispersion = .dispersion,
  n_min = .n_min,
  n_max = .n_max,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with string columns \code{x1}, \code{x2}, \code{sd1}, and \code{sd2}, as
well as numeric column \code{n}. The first two are reported group means. \code{sd1}
and \code{sd2} are reported group SDs. \code{n} is the reported total sample size. It
is not very important whether a value is in \code{x1} or in \code{x2} because, after
the first round of tests, the function switches roles between \code{x1} and
\code{x2}, and reports the outcomes both ways. The same applies to \code{sd1} and
\code{sd2}. However, do make sure the \verb{x*} and \verb{sd*} values are paired
accurately, as reported.}

\item{dispersion}{Numeric. Steps up and down from half the \code{n} values.
Default is \code{0:5}, i.e., half \code{n} itself followed by five steps up and down.}

\item{n_min}{Numeric. Minimal group size. Default is 1.}

\item{n_max}{Numeric. Maximal group size. Default is \code{NULL}, i.e., no
maximum.}

\item{rounding, threshold, symmetric, extra}{Arguments passed down to
\code{debit_map()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{x} and \code{sd}, the group-wise reported input statistics, are repeated in
row pairs.
\item \code{n} is dispersed from half the input \code{n}, with \code{n_change} tracking the
differences.
\item \code{both_consistent} flags scenarios where both reported \code{x} and \code{sd} values
are consistent with the hypothetical \code{n} values.
\item \code{case} corresponds to the row numbers of the input data frame.
\item \code{dir} is \code{"forth"} in the first half of rows and \code{"back"} in the second
half. \code{"forth"} means that \code{x2} and \code{sd2} from the input are paired with the
larger dispersed \code{n}, whereas \code{"back"} means that \code{x1} and \code{sd1} are paired
with the larger dispersed \code{n}.
\item Other columns from \code{debit_map()} are preserved.
}
}
\description{
\code{debit_map_disperse()} extends DEBIT to cases where only group
means and standard deviations (SDs) were reported, not group sizes.

The function is analogous to \code{grim_map_disperse()}, relying on the same
infrastructure.

\section{Summaries with \code{audit()}}{
 There is an S3 method for the \code{audit()}
generic, so you can call \code{audit()} following up on \code{debit_map_disperse()}
to get a tibble with summary statistics. It will have these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{x1}, \code{x2}, \code{sd1}, \code{sd2}, and \code{n} are the original inputs.
\item \code{hits_forth} is the number of scenarios in which both \code{x1} and \code{sd1}, as
well as \code{x2} and \code{x2}, are DEBIT- consistent with the dispersed \code{n} values
when \code{x2} and \code{sd2} are paired with the larger dispersed \code{n}.
\item \code{hits_back} is the same, except \code{x1} and \code{sd1} are paired with the larger
dispersed \code{n} value.
\item \code{hits_total} is the sum of \code{hits_forth} and \code{hits_back}, i.e., the total
number of both-consistent scenarios.
\item \code{scenarios_total} is the total number of test scenarios, whether or not
both \code{x1} / \code{sd1} and \code{x2} / \code{sd2} are consistent.
\item \code{hit_rate} is the ratio of \code{hits_total} to \code{scenarios_total}.

\examples{
# Run `grim_map_disperse()` on data like these:
df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~x1,    ~x2,   ~n,
  "3.43", "5.28", 90,
  "2.97", "4.42", 103
)

# The `hits_total` column shows all scenarios in
# which both divergent `n` values are GRIM-consistent
# with the `x*` values when paired with them both ways:
grim_map_disperse(data = df)

# By default (`dispersion = 0:5`), the function goes
# five steps up and down from `n`. If this sequence
# gets longer, the number of hits tends to increase:
grim_map_disperse(data = df, dispersion = 0:10)

# Get all the details with `show_all = TRUE`:
grim_map_disperse(data = df, show_all = TRUE)
