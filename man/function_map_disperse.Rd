\usage{
function_map_disperse(
  .fun,
  .name_test,
  .dispersion = 0:5,
  .n_min = 1,
  .n_max = NULL,
  .show_all = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.fun}{Function (length 1) such as \code{grim_map}: It will be used to test
rows in a data frame for consistency.}

\item{.name_test}{String (length 1). The name of the consistency test, such
as \code{"GRIM"}, to be optionally shown in a message when using the
manufactured function.}

\item{.dispersion, .n_min, .n_max, .show_all}{Arguments passed down to
\code{disperse_total()}, using defaults from there.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed down to \code{.fun}.}
}
\value{
A function. See \code{grim_map_disperse()} for an example of a function
manufactured by \code{function_map_disperse()}.
}
\description{
\code{function_map_disperse()} is the engine that powers
\code{grim_map_disperse()}. It creates new, "manufactured" functions for
consistency tests which take reported summary statistics such as means, to
apply those tests in cases where only a total sample size is known, not
group sizes.

If functions created this way are exported from other packages, they should
be written as if they were created with
\href{https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/faq-adverbs-export.html}{purrr
adverbs}; see explanations there and examples below.
}
\details{
This function is a so-called function factory: It produces other
functions, such as \code{grim_map_disperse()}. More specifically, it is a
function operator (a.k.a. decorator) because it also takes functions as
inputs, such as \code{grim_map()}. See Wickham (2019, ch. 10-11).

# Function definition of `grim_map_disperse()`:
grim_map_disperse <- function_map_disperse(
  .fun = grim_map, .name_test = "GRIM"
)

# If you want to export a function manufactured
# with `function_map_disperse()` from your own
# package, follow this pattern (except for the
# `if`-wrapping here):
if (FALSE) {

  schlim_map_disperse <- function(...) "dummy"

  .onLoad <- function(lib, pkg) {
    schlim_map_disperse <<- scrutiny::function_map_disperse(
      .fun = schlim_map, .name_test = "SCHLIM"
    )
  }
