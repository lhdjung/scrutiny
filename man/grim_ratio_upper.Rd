\usage{
grim_ratio_upper(x, percent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{String (length 1). Mean or percentage value computed from data with
integer units, e.g., mean scores on a Likert scale or percentage of study
participants in some condition. It has to be string to capture any trailing
zeros.}

\item{percent}{Logical. Set \code{percent} to \code{TRUE} if \code{x} is expressed as a
proportion of 100 rather than 1. The functions will then account for this
fact through increasing the decimal count by 2. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric.
